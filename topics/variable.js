// before starting this we must have to clear that js just not a frontend lang it is also a backend laguage 

// now suppose that i have a ecommerse website 
// and a user come on it what data i want from him 

// lets think...
// 1.name = fistname , middlename , surname
// 2.location = city , district , strict
// 3. pincode = ?
// 4.mobile number
// 5.email address 
// 6.password

// variable and constant

 // user one data
const name = "rekha thakur";
let city = "jabalpur";
var district = "seoni";
const state = "mp";
const mo_num = "8602223579";
const email_add = "rrekhathakur222@gmail.com";
const pass = "rekha@thakur";

// constant can not changed further
//name = "shobha thakur";
//console.log(name);

// let can be changed further
city = "mumbai";
console.log(city);

// var can be also changed further
district = "mm";
console.log("district");

// scope problem introduce with var  becz it is a global element
// use const and let most 

let accountState;
console.log(accountState);

let you = '';
console.log(you);
